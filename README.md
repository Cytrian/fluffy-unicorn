# Fluffy Unicorn (Kubernetes on bare-metal Workshop)

## Requirements

- Vagrant (tested: `2.1.1`)
- Make (tested: `GNU Make 3.81`)
- VirtualBox (tested: `5.2.12`)
- Docker (tested: `18.03.1-ce-mac65`)
- On MacOS use the `coreutils` (<https://www.topbug.net/blog/2013/04/14/install-and-use-gnu-command-line-tools-in-mac-os-x/>)

All the exercises are tested on MacOS.

## Exercises

Inside each folder there is an exercise matching the Workshop slides. Each exercise builts on the Knowledge of the exercise before (except for `exercise 1` :)) but can be used independently.
